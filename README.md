# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was designed as a way to gain basic fluency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I built this to both host my notes and practice their practical application, learning how to link HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a webpage, and practicing version control using Git and GitHub. I learned how to set up a basic webpage with some minimal interactability within the console.
