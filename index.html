        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains the meta data, page title, HTTP header attributes, and defines other aspects of the non-visible part of the site</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Element refers to the whole section between opening and closing tags; tags refer to the individual parts between "< >s"</li>
          <li>Parent elements refer to the top line elements that contain other elements, known as child elements</li>
          <li>id tags are used to create referenceable elements for certain elements; these will later refer to the CSS for styling.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are the most useful; however, internal CSS (in the head section) can define attributes on individual pages, and inline CSS can apply attributes to specific sections.</li>
          <li>In external CSS stylesheets, a Selector is what is being defined (either an element or a class attribute), and the Declaration states the property and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>CSS interacts with HTML in a box model (from the middle: content, padding, border, margin)</li>
          <li>Don't forget to link to external CSS sheet with a link tag in an HTML head element.</li>
          <li>Here are some specific properties (and a note on Selectors)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Use * as a wildcard selector to set property values for all sections</li>
              <li>Some properties include: margin, padding, width, height, background-color, text-align.</li>
              <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element (first value top and bottom, second value left and right).</li>
              <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>            
              <li>Start your selector with a period when defining a class attribute.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system utilizing remote and local repositories to enable collaboration with other developers by creating streamlined ways to merge work without causing conflicts due to simultaneous changes.</li>
          <li>Working in git usually requires having a main branch that folks don't work on directly, with additional branches added where the updating, deletion, or creation of content happens.</li>
          <li>These additional branches are then merged into the main one (only after a review process) to make sure that changes don't cause issues to the work as a whole.</li>
          <li>The main branch may be (and probably should be) different than the live site - for example, a dev main branch where new updates are created before they are published live.</li>
          <li>Some useful commands:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>git status</b>: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
              <li><b>git checkout branch-name</b>: can be used to move to a new branch. Use -b before branch-name to create a new branch.</li>
              <li><b>git add -A</b>: stages all files to be ready to commit. -A selects all, can stage smaller segments as well.</li>
              <li><b>git commit -m "explanation"</b>: This commits a version such that git tracks a snapshot at this time. -m allows a string to be added, explaining the commit.</li>
              <li><b>git pull origin main</b>: pulls the main branch from the remote repository, syncing with the local repository.</li>
              <li><b>git push origin branch-name</b>: syncs a local repository branch to the remote repository.</li>
              <li><b>git branch</b>: lists the current branches. Base version shows local repository, but add -r for remote repository or -a for local and remote repository.</li>
              <li><b>git ls-tree branch-name</b>: lists assets in branch-name. Add -r for remote branches.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Using github, utilize issues to track work. Github is also where you handle Pull Requests, merging of branches in the remote repository, and more.</li>
          </li>
        </ul>
